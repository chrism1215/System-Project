Got it! Here's your full README in the clean ðŸ“šðŸ’» format you want, based on your project:

#  Overview

This project implements a **Memory Management System** in C++.

It simulates a simple **memory allocator** that:

- Uses a static byte array (65,535 bytes)
- Allocates and deallocates memory dynamically
- Tracks free and allocated blocks using linked lists
- Follows best-fit memory allocation and merging free blocks on deallocation
- Reads and processes commands from a `.cmmd` file.

---

#  Features Implemented

- **INSERT [BLOCK_SIZE] [DATA]** â€” Allocate a memory block of the given size and store data.
- **READ [ID]** â€” Read and display the memory contents at a given ID.
- **UPDATE [ID] [NEW_DATA]** â€” Update existing memory block with new data.
- **DELETE [ID]** â€” Delete the memory block with the given ID and merge free space.
- **DUMP** â€” Display the current memory structure (both free and allocated blocks).

Additional Features:

- **Best-Fit Memory Allocation**  
- **Memory Defragmentation** (merge free buddies)
- **Handles ASCII and Hex input**  
- **Automatic ID assignment** for blocks.

---

#  Testing

Unit tests were written inside `main()` and verified:

- Inserted blocks store correct data
- Read operations retrieve correct data or error if missing
- Updates resize and reallocate correctly
- Deleting a block merges free blocks
- Dump correctly shows memory layout

 Proper output verified through sample `.cmmd` files.

# Instructions to Compile and Run

1. Open a Terminal** and navigate to your project folder:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/MemoryManagerProject
   ```

2. Compile the Code**

   ```bash
   g++ src/memory_manager.cpp -o memory_manager
   ```

3. Create a `.cmmd` File** (example `commands.cmmd`):

   ```
   INSERT 16 hello
   READ 0
   UPDATE 0 world
   DELETE 0
   DUMP
   ```

4. Run the Program**

   ```bash
   ./memory_manager commands.cmmd
   ```

   Your memory manager will process the commands sequentially.
